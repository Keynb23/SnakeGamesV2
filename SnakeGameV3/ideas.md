LEVEL 1: 

AFTER 10 POINTS

add a 5 slow moving food squares, that last for about 10 seconds, but around 7 seconds they start to blink/flash, then at 10 seconds they vanish. Each food gives 1.25 multiplyer to your points and a .5 multiplyer to your lenth.
for those 10 seconds, you can get a score of 6.25 added just for eating those foods, on top of you eating the main food.

LEVEL 2:
AFTER 25 POINTS

the same thing happens, but the 5 slow moving food squares are now 10 moving food squares that move as fast as you. Multiplyer doesn't change, but you can get more points because there are more of them.

LEVEL 3:
AFTER 50 POINTS

the color scheme inverts after each key pressed (PUT A SIEZURE WARNING), plus the main food is now running away from you. You just need to capture it once.
this give you 25 points

LEVEL 4:
AFTER 100 POINTS

the game looks like sunshine, rainbows, lollypops, butterflies, and a nice cute rabbit family having a picnic by water. Papa rabit is fishing on the shore, the momma rabit is reading her rabit book, and their baby rabit is investigating a bush, evenly between them.

As the baby rabit gets close, a big snake pops out, the baby rabits falls on its fluffy butt and tries to run away, but the snake eats him in one bite. Blood goes everywhere. splatters the dad's face. 

the mom screams for her child, the snake lunges at the mom, the dad looks back and leaps to his wife's aid, but is too late. The snake eats her and slithers away. The Momma rabit drops down to her knees in tears. Declaring vengence.

Pan up into the sun. SCREEN YELLOW

KILL BILL MUSIC, BUT NOT THE WHISTLE the Ironside Siren Sound

The Momma Rabit is dressed like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill with the all yellow outfit, and her sword. She's surounded by a bunch of snakes (Recreating the iconic black and white scene from kill bill, but all yellow with a black siloette for the momma rabit and black siloettes for snakes and red for blood after each slash)

now  the game is 3D rendered from this point on, which is the final mission: You are the rabit and you have to take down the snake. This would be like any rpg slasher game where the boss fight has a big boss with a big hp bar and you have to keep hacking slashing it until it drops it's guard to cut off it's head, but once you cut off it's head, it grows two more.

The only way to beat it, is let it swallow you hole, then you must punch your way through like how Uma escaped the coffin, but in this case. A snake's belly.

Then the game ends.
